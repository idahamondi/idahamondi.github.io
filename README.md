# Idah Omondi — Portfolio

This is a Carrd-inspired multi-page static portfolio for GitHub Pages.

## How to use
1. Upload all files and the `assets` folder to a GitHub repository named `idahamondi.github.io` (or any repo and enable Pages as needed).
2. Replace `assets/profile.jpg` with your real profile image (keep the same filename OR update the `src` in HTML).
3. Replace `resume.pdf` with your resume in the repository root to enable download.
4. Edit the HTML files to update content (projects, skills, contact).
5. Pages are static — to update, edit and re-upload or use Git/GitHub Desktop.
